;;; Commentary:

;; Note: this package is still early stage. I'm going to
;; support [nim-mode](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim-mode) first and
;; then other programming major-modes.
;;
;; If your nim-mode merged this PR (https://github.com/nim-lang/nim-mode/pull/138)
;; and you already configured nimsuggest, you can use suggestion-box
;; without configuration.
;;
;;
;; This package is more or less for major-mode maintainers who want to
;; show type information on the cursor and currently only tested on
;; nim-mode (https://github.com/nim-lang/nim-mode).

;; The tooltip will be placed above on the current cursor, so most of
;; the time, the tooltip doesn't destruct your auto-completion result.

;; How to implement:
;;
;; if you want to show type information after company-mode's
;; :post-completion or :exit-function for `completion-at-point',
;; you may implement something like this:
;;
;;   (defun xxx-completion-at-point ()
;;      ... ; do something
;;     :exit-function (lambda (string status)
;;                      (if STRING-IS-FUNCTION
;;                         (insert "()")
;;                         (backward-char 1)
;;                         (suggestion-box TYPE-INFO)))
;;     )
;;
;;
;; But, I might change API to reduce defgeneric/defmethod stuff, so
;; please keep in mind this package isn't stable yet.
