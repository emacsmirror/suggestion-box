;;; Commentary:

;; This package is more or less for major-mode maintainers who want to
;; show type information on the cursor and currently only tested on
;; nim-mode (https://github.com/nim-lang/nim-mode).

;; The tooltip will be placed above on the current cursor, so most of
;; the time, the tooltip doesn't destruct your auto-completion result.

;; How to use:
;;
;; if you just want to show type information after company-mode's
;; :post-completion or :exit-function for `completion-at-point',
;; you may implement something like this:
;;
;;   (defun xxx-completion-at-point ()
;;      ... ; do something
;;     :exit-function (lambda (string status)
;;                      (if STRING-IS-FUNCTION
;;                         (insert "()")
;;                         (backward-char 1)
;;                         (suggestion-box TYPE-INFO)))
;;     )
